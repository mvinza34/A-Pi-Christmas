2) Plug in the Raspberry Pi 4 Model B.
3) Copy the files in this repository to the Pi.
4) Go to 'Terminal' and install pygame - Community Edition using the command 'pip install pygame-ce'. Then, type 'pip install pygame-ce --upgrade' to get the latest version of pygame.
5) Open main.py and settings.py
6) To add more holiday-themed music, go to onlinesequencer.net and pick a song. Click edit, select all notes with CTRL + A, and then copy them with CTRL + C.
7) Go to settings.py and paste the string. Make sure to remove "Online Sequencer:120233:" from the start and ";:" from the end.
8) Run main.py
9) Enjoy the music, lights, and a nice little animation at the end, and have a wonderful Happy Holidays!
